# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

- As a developer you already have enough on your plate.
- I wanted to make this journey a bit more pleasant by creating this README generator.
- I build this project for developers who like me spend hours creating amazing programs and could use an extra tool in our tool library to ease work load.
- This generator will automatically create your projects README with just a few text inputs  saving you precious time  that can be used  to focus on the more important tasks.
- In this project i learned that you cant never have too much help as a developer.
